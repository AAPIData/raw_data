# Raw Demographic data for AAPI Data Tools

- Here is where we store the most recent data for (Community Facts)[http://facts.aapidata.com/]

## Structure

The repository contains three files in the `data_factsheets` folder:

1. test_dta.csv = the underlying raw data (rows = ethnic groups, columns = estimates)
2. topic_lookup.csv = label information for each column name in the first file
3. source_information.csv = source information grouped by topic area
